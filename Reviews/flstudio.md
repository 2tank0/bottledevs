# FL Studio
Review for the flstudio installer.

Maintainers: @BobyMCbobs & @mirkobrombin

**Is the program properly opened?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: Eventually freeze on start for 2s. (This is typical behavior for FL. Same issue is present in the versions 11, 12, and 21.)

**Is it showing alerts or other warnings?**  
Grade: Platinum
Additional notes: n/a

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: Tested UI scaling, prettify and plugin rendering.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: Out of the box, no additional tweaking is required. However, some third-party VSTs will not work without installing extra dependencies.

**Did it crash during tests execution?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: So far no crashes encountered during testing.

**Is it usable?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: All the main functionalities work as expected.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**  
Grade: Gold
Additional notes: n/a

**Additional notes**
The FL Cloud sounds library is not working as expected and generates a silent error. However, other FL Cloud functionalities, such as mastering and downloading Flex presets, work as intended.
