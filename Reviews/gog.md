Grade: Platinum  
Additional n/a

**Does it show graphical glitches?**  
Grade: Gold  
Additional notes: Lag on launch but works smoothly after login.

**Does it require some tweaking in order to work properly? (Out of normal software configuration)**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Did it crash during tests execution?**  
Grade: Platinum  
Additional notes: n/a

**Is it usable?**  
Grade: Silver  
Additional notes: GalaxyClientService.exe crashes often, bringing up an alert window and interrupting gameplay. The best way to go about it is to not dismiss the alert, just Alt+Tab back to the game, that way you won't get further interruptions from that alert.

**Final grade? (the lower evaluation from previous questions)**  
Grade: Silver  
Additional notes: n/a
